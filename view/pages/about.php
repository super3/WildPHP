    <p>
        WildPHP&#8217;s simple mission is to teach beginners PHP  through video tutorials, articles and scripts. We also want to provide resources 
        for developing PHP projects, just to make things easier.

    <p>
        The primary author for this site, <a href="http://super3.org">Super3</a>, started programming PHP as a teenager. Well known
        for his work making <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/super3boy">Blender 3D Tutorials</a>, he decided to use his gift of
        teaching to share another of his passions, PHP. These tutorials are designed, unlike many others on the web, to explain the
        difficult concept of PHP programming in as simple a manner as possible.
